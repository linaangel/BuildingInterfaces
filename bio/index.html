        <h2>About Lina</h2>
         <p>Lina from Colombia is quite a talker! She is a trained Biologist and Graphic Designer who loves animals, traveling, and meeting new people. She used to live with her sweet dog Otto, now she lives with her boyfriend Manuel Sanmiguel. She has a big family from the "Paisas" region of Colombia, though her grandparents were from Manizales and Medellin so she loves to eat arepas (a food similar to Mexican tortillas).</p> 
            <p>Here you can get an idea of here favorite things:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Favorite book:</strong> The Shack by William P. Young.</li> 
            <li><strong>Favorite movie:</strong> The Ultimate Gift, with Abigail Breslin.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorite television show:</strong> House, M.D.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorite hobbies:</strong> Spending some time with Otto (my dog), watching movies, sharing things through social media, and biking.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorite quote:</strong><cite> â€œIf you spend your whole life waiting for the storm, you'll never enjoy the sunshine." Morris West</cite></li></ul> 

            <p><strong>Greatest personal accomplishment:</strong><br> After my Smithsonian Internship about courtship in <a href="http://business.highbeam.com/434953/article-1G1-176838043/courtship-and-calories" target="_blank">Violinist crabs</a>, I did my Biology degree project and it became known all over the world, with <a href="http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-3940044" target="_blank">news</a> articles in different languages. Also it was very rewarding when she earned the Marketing Excelence Award when she used to work at Avaya</p>

<p><strong>What would people be most surprised to learn about you?</strong><br>
    That I can't smell and that I'm also a Biologist besides a Graphic Designer.</p>
